- Not sure why stack is not working

- According to the flamecharts preparing the statements takes a third of the time. Also setting the schema takes some time.
- Going to remove the schema setting first to simplify the code. Then I'll use prepared statements.
- The reason I need the schema is for a prefix for the notify
- One option is to remove it and the figure out how to add it back.
- Yeah I'm going to do that. I would like to keep things simple as I improve perf
- I think it needs to make a record of function based on the string

# 1/12/20

- I wish there were actual benchmarks already setup.
- I want to see if the `pg_wait_sampling` provides any insight.
- Not really about to see any perf issues just looking at the tests.
  - I need to make actual benchmarks to stress the system.
- Some thoughts about benchmarks
  - I need to warm the caches when setting up
  - I should run vacuum analyze full and reindex before running.
  - I would like to be able to `pg_wait_sampling` as well.
- I feel like I am going to want to be able replay what happens when there is contention.
- I should map out what happens as the consumers and producers numbers are adjusted.
- I don't think I should write a criterion benchmark for this. I think I should have a
  exe that that could how many queues/enqueues in some amount of time.
  - It should take args for
    - number of producers
    - number of consumers
    - number of time
    - initial number dequeued payloads
    - initial number of enqueued payloads
# Decemeber 27th 2019

The result of removing a postgres instance.

The old times are on the left and the new (removed instance) are on the right.

1.6324 1.4624 R
1.6689 1.6946 L
1.7416 1.3665 R
1.8576 1.5354 R
1.8035 1.5383 R
1.7434 1.4234 R

1.7444 1.4729 R
1.6803 1.4600 R
1.6598 1.6410 R

Removing an instance wins.
